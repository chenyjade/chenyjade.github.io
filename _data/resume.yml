projects:
  - name: AI platform
    description: Huawei's internal AI platform based on Hadoop, Spark, Zeppelin, etc., consists of data preparation, data exploration, model development, model deployment, etc., and I participated in the development of data preparation, including automatic data import(from HDFS into Hive, using PySpark) and data annotation. We developed an Image/Video annotaion tool based on PyQt, explored the latest detection/tracking algorithms like ECO and deeplabV3, built up a pre-labeling service(based on Flask) in order to accelarate the process of data annotation 
  - name: Toxic Comment Classification Challenge
    description: A comment classification challenge on kaggle, we’re challenged to build a multi-headed model that’s capable of detecting different types of of toxicity. I have built up a bi-GRU model with some tricks like ensemble and end with silver medal (153/4551) 
  - name: CTR estimation based on Hadoop
    description: Our course project, Achieved an accuracy at 88% with only text features.
  - name: Lebbang APP
    description: A platform focused on mutual help on campus, developed the backend with Django REST framework.
  - name: Causes and measures of fomenting medical disturbance 
    description: A research focused on medical disturbance in China, I crawled the information on Weibo and analysed those information using some NLP techniques like Topic Model.
